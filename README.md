## Notes
- There's a configuration file found in {BUILD_FOLDER}/Config/config.ini
- Resource files get copied to the build folder, so after building the project the config file inside the build folder should be edited and not the one in the project folder.
- Almost all textures can be changed inside the .ini file, I've included some textures that can be used, much thanks to the people on itch.io.

## Rules
- Try to reach the finish line as fast as you can
- Avoid obstacles and other racers
- Hitting obstacles or racers shall be punished
- Highscores are saved inbetween runs, so try to beat your previous score!

## Controls
All controls can be changed in the config file.
- Up: W
- Down: S
- Left: A
- Right: D
- Yell: Y
- Change speed: F

## (Extra) Features
- Easily customizable and highly configurable game (ini file config)
	- Everything from textures to sounds to controls is configurable
- Animated characters / entities
- Dynamic animation speed adjustment
